## About
The Teach In Cambodia website is the central hub for information regarding volunteering & teaching in Cambodia.
It provides tips on how to travel to Cambodia, visa requirements, a survival guide, etc.
It also provides teaching resources for participating Non-Governmental Organizations, and a hub of opportunities for volunteers looking to participate in the effort to provide quality education to Cambodian citizens.
## The Goal
* Increase awareness of volunteering opportunities in Cambodia
* Provide quality information for potential volunteers
* Connect volunteers with NGO posted positions
* Aid in building a curriculum for Cambodian education by providing teaching resources
## The Vision
In Cambodia, it is often the case that teachers may be uneducated, untrained, or both.
The vision of Teach In Cambodia is to help create a set curriculum and build a structure for education in Cambodia. In order to do this, TiC will provide lesson plans, content, and other resources, for teachers to use or contribute to.

Increasing awareness and knowledge for potential volunteers is also a high priority. 
Volunteers should know how to travel to & within Cambodia, the risks of volunteering here, the qualms of picking an NGO to work with, visa information, etc.
By providing information (+ a survival guide), volunteers can gain knowledge of the opportunities, and also view potential positions posted by other NGOs.
